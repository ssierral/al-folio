Hi! I am Sebastian Sierra and I am a research assistant for the [Chair of Software Systems](https://sws.informatik.uni-leipzig.de){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Leipzig. My research interests include authorship attribution, natural language processing, generative adversarial networks and source code modeling. 

Currently, I am working in the project "Generating code suggestions using Deep Learning".
